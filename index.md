## SDG&E Capstone B08, Phi Nguyen

# So far, the most interesting factor that I learned is how computer vision is actually being used in the energy distribution company for public safety.
# I would like to learn more about object measurement in computer vision so I can do a project that summarizes the danger level of the tree and the pole.
# I am planning to go deeper in terms of object detection. Using the object detection, I will build the model that works with the database for the data quality control.
# I would like to learn more about the database system and the visualization that SDGE uses.
